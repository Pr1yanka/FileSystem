>>>>> About

This project implements hgfs a new filesystem based on unix system v filesystem. The design of the
filesystem is in progress donot use this yet. 

Filesystem does supports :	- mount on linux-kernel-3.13.0.48
							- Reading content of a file
							- listing content of directory
							- limited (512 bytes) write support into the file if offset is specified

>>>>> Architecture hgfs 1.0

Block size:		 512 bytes
Block count :	 8192
Block zero: 	 Boot block 
Block 1+2: 	 	 Super block
Block 3 to 10:	 Inode blocks
Block 11 to 14:  Root directory blocks
Block 15 to 8191:Data blocks 
                   
>>>>> Patch Submission

Please send a merge request only if you are ready to publish your changes according to unix system v filesystem standards.

I would like to keep the filesystem simple and minimal so that it can be used as a good learning material.


TODO
-----
- After the 1.0 release, 
		-start with support for writing large data into the file
		-implement indirect, double indirect, triple indirect data block pointers in inode
	

>>>>> PACKAGE CONTENTS

hgfs_mkfs.c		Code to initialize filesystem image
hgfs.c			filesystem driver
hgfs.h			necessary declarations,macro definations
README			This file
Makefile		to build the module
disk image		initialized filesystem image with welcome file
Example			Contains examples

>>>>> compilation and installation

For building This filesystem you should have Linux (any distribution) with kernel version-3.13.0.* (
try yourself to test on other kernel-versions). And GCC C compiler

1. git clone hgfs ripository

2. Edit Makefile for your configuration (if necessary)  the default parameters should
   be suitable.

3. Execute make to build

4. Run hgfs_mkfs to initialize the filesytem image.

5. insert module 

6. mount the hgfs filesystem
